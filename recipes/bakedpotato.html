<h2>What it will be</h2><br>
If you want the yummy taste of a slowly baked potato but aren't patient enough, <br>or don't have the know-how to bake it in an oven, this is for you. Give it 12 minutes and get a mouth-watering, taste bud-tingling treat.
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 large russet potato</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter or margarine</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons sour cream</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Step </li>
    Scrub the potato, and prick several time with the tines of a fork. Place on a plate.
    <li>Step </li>
    Cook on full power in the microwave for 5 minutes. Turn over, and continue to cook for 5 more minutes.<br>
     When the potato is soft, remove from the microwave, and cut in half lengthwise. Season with salt and pepper, <br>
     and mash up the inside a little using a fork. Top the open sides with butter and 2 tablespoons of cheese. Return to the microwave, <br>
     and cook for about 1 minute to melt the cheese.
    <li>Step </li>
    Top with remaining cheese and sour cream, and serve.
